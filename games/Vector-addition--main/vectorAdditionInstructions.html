        <h1>Vector Addition Game - Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Vector Addition Game! This game is a fun way to learn and understand the concept of vector addition in 2D space.</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At the start of each round, two vectors (Vector A and Vector B) will be displayed on the screen.</li>
            <li>Your task is to guess the location of the resultant vector (Vector C), which is the sum of Vector A and Vector B.</li>
            <li>Click on the canvas where you think the tip of Vector C should be located.</li>
            <li>After you make your guess, the actual location of Vector C will be revealed.</li>
            <li>The game measures the distance between your guess and the actual vector sum. A shorter distance means a more accurate guess.</li>
            <li>The game consists of 5 rounds. Try to be as accurate as possible in each round!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Your score is based on the accuracy of your guesses. The cumulative distance over all rounds will determine your final score. The lower the total distance, the better your score!</p>
        <p>Have fun and learn about vector addition!</p>

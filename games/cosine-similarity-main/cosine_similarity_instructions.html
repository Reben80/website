        <h1>Vector Similarity Game - Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Vector Similarity Game! This game is designed to help you understand the concept of cosine similarity between vectors.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Cosine Similarity</h2>
        <p>Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It's a value between -1 and 1, where 1 means the vectors are identical, 0 means they are orthogonal (independent), and -1 means they are completely opposite.</p>
        <p>The formula for cosine similarity is:</p>
        <p>\( \text{Cosine Similarity} (A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|} \)</p>
        <p>where \( A \cdot B \) is the dot product of vectors A and B, and \( \|A\| \) and \( \|B\| \) are the magnitudes (lengths) of vectors A and B.</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Two vectors will be displayed on the screen as dots.</li>
            <li>Your task is to guess the cosine similarity between these two vectors.</li>
            <li>Type your guess in the input box. The guess should be a number between -1 and 1.</li>
            <li>Submit your guess and see how close you were to the actual cosine similarity.</li>
            <li>The game consists of 5 rounds. Try to get as close as possible in each round!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Your score is based on how close your guess is to the actual cosine similarity. The closer you are, the better your score!</p>
        <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>

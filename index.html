            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Montgomery College. I am from Kurdistan, Iraq. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Ohio University in May 2020 and have been teaching at Montgomery College since August 2020. I love teaching and I believe equity is an important aspect of education. In my classrooms, I try my best to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. I believe that it is important to actively work toward creating a more equitable and just society. I implement active learning techniques, such as Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), and I am interested in standards-based grading (SBG) as a way to more accurately assess student learning and progress. One goal I am currently focusing on is creating engaging and fun activities for my classroom from making art, creating 3D objects, and creating simple, interactive web-based games to increase student excitement about my class.  In my free time, I enjoy reading manga, watching anime (and I am a Star Wars fan), building Gundam, playing chess, mountain biking, creating Islamic Geometric Art. and recently 3D printing. </p>
